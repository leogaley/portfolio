## ABOUT ME

Thanks for visiting my portfolio!  I am new to web development and really enjoying learning how front end and back end technologies work together.  My favorite projects to work on are those where I can take a pragmatic approach to utilizing technology to support business needs.  In other words, problem solving and business analysis is the driver for what technologies to use.<br><br>Since 2013 I have been working to try and create a very efficient and customized ERP system (Netsuite) for KC Store Fixtures.  That includes the creation of hundreds of scripts, workflows, searches, and other customizations that are guided by business rules. <br> <br>

Adding front and back end web development to my toolkit is allowing me to pursue some areas that I have always wanted to.  Continuous improvement of my own skillset is something I take great pride in, I love a challenge and I love problem-solving.   


## MORE INFO

Graduate of University of Missouri, BS Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, MBA.  I have a wife and one child, of course he is Leo M Galey V!  I unapologetically play plenty of video games, plus watch and play as many sports as I have time for.  As I get older I am pursuing becoming only a half-decent (but exuberant) golfer.  I also enjoy reading all types of books, watching movies and documentaries. And now I pursue coding in my spare time as well. <br><br>  Some unique life experiences have given me an (I think) uncommon and positive perspective on life - and I have a very, very supportive wife and family.
